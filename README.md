A bit harder than I initially thought, 
25 lines of javascript has taken me 8 hours and I'm still not finished.


stuck here - How do I make make the CSS respond to the javascript function NUM
so that the CSS reacts dynamically in response to the prompt making the HTML element #container also change?

So if I type 20 in the prompt() I get a #container with a grid-template-columns property from CSS of NUM
